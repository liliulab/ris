RIS (Refugee Identification System) <BR><BR>
RIS classifies refugees and non-refugees based on an individual's age, residential address, and primary language.<BR> 
Because the current RIS is trained using Arizona state data, it can be applied to Arizonans only.<BR> 
However, we provide codes to re-train RIS with data from other US states.
